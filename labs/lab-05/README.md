# LAB 5 — Extract recipe from email newsletter

*Add an Outlook trigger that ingests newsletter emails and routes the body to your agent for recipe extraction.*

## Why This Matters

Inbound automation converts passive content into actionable data with zero copy‑paste.

## 🌐 Introduction

Configure `When a new email arrives (V3)` to watch for a specific subject and pass the content to the agent with additional instructions. This sets the stage for unattended ingestion.

## 🎓 Core Concepts Overview

|Concept|Why it matters|

|Event‑driven triggers|Bring fresh data to the agent without manual steps.|
|Connector health|Green status avoids silent failures.|
|Targeted subject filters|Prevents noisy or irrelevant processing.|
