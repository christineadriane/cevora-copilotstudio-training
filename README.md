# 🚀 Welcome to the Copilot Studio Hands‑On Workshop!
This is a hands-on workshop where you’ll build real AI agents using Copilot Studio — no coding experience required. We’ll explore:

- How agents work
- How to add knowledge sources
- How to create actions with Power Automate
- How conversational topics and triggers work
- Governance, environments & safe deployment
- Publishing agents to Teams and other channels

Everything in this workshop is done through the browser — no CLI, no VS Code, no installing developer tools.
To make sure you can follow every step smoothly, please check the setup below.

#### **💻 1. Bring your laptop**
- Windows 10/11 or macOS
- Modern browser: Edge or Chrome (recommended)

#### **🔐 2. What YOU need as a participant**
- ✔ Microsoft 365 account (non‑guest)
- ✔ Copilot Studio license (free, must be assigned)
- ✔ Permission level: Environment Maker (or higher)

This gives you the right access to:
- Create Copilot agents
- Add knowledge sources
- Build/modify Power Automate flows
- Create connections
- *You do NOT need Microsoft 365 Copilot for this workshop, but is a "nice to have"*

#### **🏗️ 3. What the company must have ready (important!)**
In the tenant, you must ensure:
- ✔ A Dataverse‑enabled Power Platform environment
- Preferably: a dedicated Dev environment for experimentation.
- ✔ Copilot Studio turned ON in that environment (It's not always enabled by default)
- ✔ Power Automate enabled (for actions & workflows)
- ✔ DLP policies that ALLOW standard connectors
  - SharePoint
  - OneDrive
  - Dataverse
  - Office 365 connectors
  - HTTP (optional)
- ✔ No policies blocking:
  - Creating agents
  - Editing agents
  - Adding knowledge sources
  - Creating actions
  - Custom triggers
  - Publishing to Teams

If the tenant is heavily locked down, creating a temporary “workshop DLP policy” is recommended.

#### **4. Skills you’ll find handy**

It’s nice if you’ve at least seen these:
- Power Platform basics: solutions, agents ([Intro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-solutions/) | [Copilot Studio basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-virtual-agents-bots/) | [Copilot Studio Academy](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-academy/))

#### 🧪 Optional 10-minute warm-up
Not required, but helpful:
#### 🟣 Warm‑up Lab 1: Access check
- Open https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com
- Make sure you can create a new agent
- Try adding a simple knowledge source (a doc or a SharePoint site)

If this works → You’re 100% ready.

Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop
